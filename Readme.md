# Automobile MPG Predictor Using Polynomial Regression

## About
This project uses **polynomial regression** to predict automobile fuel efficiency (MPG) based on weight, but can be modified to include other vehicle features such as horsepower, and displacement. Unlike linear regression, polynomial regression captures **nonlinear relationships** in the data, providing more accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Features
- Handles missing values using mean imputation.
- Expands features polynomially to capture nonlinear trends.
- Compares linear and polynomial regression models.
- Visualizes relationships between vehicle attributes and MPG.
- Provides interpretable coefficients to understand how features impact fuel efficiency.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Dataset:** [Auto MPG Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mpg.csv)  
- Features include cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automobile-mpg-polynomial-regression.git
